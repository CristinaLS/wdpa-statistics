## A repository for analytical tools on the World Database on Protectd Areas.

#### Author: Ed Lewis
#### Date: October 2019
#### Purpose: A centralised, comprehensive and public repository for WDPA analytical tools.

See the Wiki for a comprehensive introduction to the repo's content.

Steps to undertake the monthly update of PA statistics:
1. Run the script/model (enter name)
2. QC the results (QC checks to be made and then automated)
3. Copy key global tabular outputs into the global summary working doc
4. Format the global results in the summary working doc
5. Copy these formatted global results into the global reporting template
6. Copy the national results into the national reporting template
7. Send the Informatics team the global and national reporting stats for the month


Future ideas of things to embed/test:
1. In python we're no longer limited to one iterator - so can we use multiple for/list loops to process the countries/pame together and-or faster?
2. how to speed it up even more?
3. simplify the outputs? is in_memory sufficient to run this on my/other computers?
4. test the windows timed activity ability to run this at a specified interval 
5. embed the ability to test when the WDPA is updated or changed?
6. maximise the types of tabular/statistical outputs that are made. 
7. Make and then automate the QC checks for the global, national and pame stats
