## A repository for analytical tools on the World Database on Protectd Areas.

***

#### Author: Ed Lewis
#### Date: October 2019
#### Purpose: A centralised, comprehensive and public repository for WDPA analytical tools.

See the Wiki for a comprehensive introduction to the repo's content.

Future ideas of things to embed/test:
1. In python we're no longer limited to one iterator - so can we use multiple for/list loops to process the countries/pame together and-or faster?

2. how to speed it up even more?

3. simplify the outputs? is in_memory sufficient to run this on my/other computers?

4. test the windows timed activity ability to run this at a specified interval 

5. embed the ability to test when the WDPA is updated or changed?

6. maximise the types of tabular/statistical outputs that are made.
